## **üì¶ Overview of Modules**

### **1. üöó Trajectory Planning Module (Ethical Frenet Planner)**

- **Function**: Implements a trajectory planner with ethical constraints, supporting safe and reasonable trajectory generation in CommonRoad standard scenarios.
- **Features**: Allows scenario-specific testing and visualizes both the decision-making process and generated trajectories.

---

### **2. üßæ Logging & Evaluation Tools**

- **Metrics**: Includes cumulative harm score, safety violations, and comfort evaluation.
- **Batch Evaluation**:
  - Supports large-scale testing on 2000+ CommonRoad scenarios.
  - Generates visual metrics such as speed and acceleration curves (see plot_vel_acc.py).
- **Hardware Requirements**:
  - Approx. 200 GB disk space required;
  - Multi-threading and GPU acceleration recommended (e.g., 8√ó RTX3090).

------

### **3. üó∫Ô∏è Scenario Resources (CommonRoad Benchmark Scenarios)**

- **Location**: commonroad-scenarios/
- **Source**: [CommonRoad Project](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/)
- **Purpose**: Provides diverse and high-fidelity simulation environments for testing planning and decision-making generalization capabilities.

------

### **4. üîÅ Active Inference Module**

- **Location**: Active_Inference/
- **Function**: Implements an Active Inference-based decision-making mechanism that can be plugged into the planner to replace the default module.
- **Use Case**: Enables behavior selection driven by information gain, especially under uncertainty in perception.

------

### **5. üß≠ Trajectory Visualization Tool**

- **Location**: visualize_tool/
- **Function**: Visualizes planned trajectories with overlays including:
  - Path progression,
  - Speed and acceleration distribution,
  - Risk maps and other metrics.
- **Advantage**: Supports multi-dimensional overlays for effective debugging and interpretability analysis.

------

### **6. üß† Cognitive Encoding Module**

- **Integration**: Embedded within the frenet_planner pipeline (Perception ‚Üí Encoding ‚Üí Decision).
- **Function**: Extracts high-level semantic features from raw environment input, simulating human-like cognitive pre-processing before decision-making.
- **Input Features**: Spatial relationships, relative velocities, and behavioral intentions.
- **Purpose**: Provides interpretable and structured feature support to improve planning behavior and social sensitivity.
